     <h1> AI Sentience</h1>
     <h2> Sentient AI is beneficial, but it will not proide a serious threat to human employment</h2>
<h4> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The World is changing. Problems and solutions used to be restricted only by the ingenuity and creativity of human intelligence. This is no longer the case. In teh 60s, complex supercomputers chewed equations that allowed achievement higher than what the human brain could achieve, such as launching a rocket into space. Today powerful machines that seem to mimic, or perhaps hold a form of artificial intelligence are changing the way we work, browse, and live. Likewise, paranoia and fear of these entities are arising just as swiftly. Luckily for us, Sentient Artificial Intelligence is beneficial, but it iwll not provide a serious threat to human employment and will serve only as a time-to-tome resource. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Artificial Intelligence will not post a worthwhile threat to human employment. Although analysts have projections starting that with the current movement &quot; AI holds a 15-35 percent chance of replacing all information knowledge-based jobs by the 2030s, these claims just are not taking all of the data into account &quot;(New York Times 2022). To start, no matter how much programmers push for their creations for fame and advertising, artificial intelligence will never truly be sentient, meaning having feeling. The biggest factor weighing into this is that computer programs are unable to reason and make choices, only repeating patterns or mimicking other inputs. Although some researchers claim that this attitude is the same &quot;as that of a child mimicking &quot;, this is not fully accurate(New York Times 2022). Children at first begin copying and mimicking, but in time learn to make their own choices and experiemnt. Anyone that has any experience with young children could udnerstand this: from pouring squash on the ground to finding sneezes wildy amusing. Hitting heavier on the build-up of a computer, everything comes back to a 1 or a 0, meaning a charge or no charge only 2 total options per choice. These expand on each other making complex possibilites, that grow into the internet, programs, and applications that we know today. Human brains, taht can feel, do not work like this. &quot;Even the most decorated pyscologists do not truly know how the brain works on a micro standpoint&quot;(New York Times 2022). To what we know now, the human brain is infinitely more complex and this complexity explains the ability to hav ecomplex and in-depth feelings, that machinery will never be able to contian. <br> Diving into the threat of human employment, which may seem insuperable to some, but on a closer glance is not very daunting. Artificial Intelligence programs, such as the newly-made GTP-3 system, are solving once impossible formulas and problems, such as the resolution of a &quot; decades-old-gemoetrical-biological-structural formula &quot;(New York Times 2022). Artificial Intelligence is not something programs taking a large number of human jobs and devouring the workforce just is not supported by anything other than fear. Good AI that has been correctly and efficently devloped can work on very complicated problems, but very specific problems. The reason that AI will able to take many jobs is that AI does not have the flexibility to solve different types of problems throughout the day, like a human does every day. Not even to mention the multi-dimensional reality of even the simplest jobs. In a world with humans, a program just cannot blend in, from talking about coffe, connecting with co-workers, compromising, debating, and applying information into pratical solutions in the real world. AI no doubt can evolve into some technical-based jobs, but the arena is small, and will still need humans to work with them. AI may be amazing at some things, and will no doubt over time become a coveted tool in the workplace, but it will never fully replace the craftsmen and women.<br>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Artificial Intelligence has gotten sweeter over time and will continue to develop into the desired tool in workplaces and recreation that will assist mankid for years to come.</h4>
