    <h3> George's project involved building an app based around mentoring computer science II and I peers. This is a serious problem and a practial soltuion. Computer Scinece is a fast-based course and many studnets can fall behind and drown in the concepts and the coursework.  The reasons that I considered this project was because it would be simple, and the majority of the project would be more around the app itself, and not nessecairly difficult coding. One of my weakness in computer science is working in the shell and forming links. Once I have that worked out, such as this project, I would spend the majority coding the information and layout of the app. The reason I chose to not join this ISP group, was that there were too many members for to little of a project. I would feel that there wouldn't be enough work to do, and eventually we would be split up or somethign would change in the project. I want a moderate challenge for the ISP projet, and I also want security knowing what I work on is my project and I will not be moved </h3>

    <h3>This project really grabbed my intrest and attention. The project propsosal form was very neatly layed out and full of graphics and beautiful design. The project itself would be programming games into a website, which sounds really fun and challenging. Gaming is a very active part of the high school culture and lifestyle. Fun disposable games to pass the time are common and very prominent in the high school, the most common being the snake google game. Many high school students need a sort of mindless fun to pass the dead time of high school, while not seeking for serious joy or active attention time.  The problem is that the language they were using, pyhton, isn't one that I am very well proficient at. And the ideas for the games themselve are very complex, and I feel would be much too challenging for me to work through. As much as I would like to join a project like this, I want to be a part of a group where I am not dragging down, and actaully contirbuting a fair amount. For that reason, I had to delcine this project, because it is a little too complex for my level. </h3>

    <h3> Matthews idea is very similar to George's, in that it is based on making a mentoring and tutoring enviorment for computer science. The problem is real, and the soltuion makes sense. I can see this being used day-to-day with mentoring in computer science. This project seems at my level, and simple enough to code, but the cons were greater than the pros for this ISP Project. This project seems very similar to other projects that are being made so I would lack the security of this project lasting in the long run. The idea doesn't seemed to well devloped yet, so I don't want to risk putting my time and effort into a project that will not last. So for that reason I have to decline this project.</h3>

<h3>Austin's project seems to be the most reasonable out of all of them that I looked at. The idea is a great solution to a problem of spacing with large TV's. The TV's would be 360 degrees and circular, and holding the ability to move based on the movement of the users. This would maxmimize room space in small homes, apartments, or even bars. Allowins more entertainment with less square footage. The main problem with this is that the problem seems very complex to solve, and might be a little too complex for my skills. It seems like this project would be a majority of actually physically desinging the soltuion, on top of all of the coding that needs to take place. I love the idea, but it seems very ambitious and I don't feel confidnet placing my time in something that might not even be able to be solved.  </h3>

<h3> I loved this project, the proposal page, the overall idea, and the soltuion. It seems practical, reasonable, and I can see this being used in the school. The school lunch lines are very long, full of the repeating every day iteraction of scanning a bar code and picking up food, and waiting for it ot be ready. If you take away the scanning and ordering, it would save much time for the students, and the staff members, a win-win.  The soltuion is a online ordering system for lunch, that takes away dead time of waiting in lines. It makes perfect sense and I would love to be a part of this project. The main problem for me is that it seems to simple. This idea is great, but I believe it could be coded in a week, leaving lots of dead time. Becuase of this, I don't think it would be challenging, and I wouldn't be a contributing member of the team, as I want to be. </h3>

<h3> This propsal was very well designed and appealing to the eye. For this reason I was initially intrested in joining this project. But the problems I had with this project was that it seemed semi-usless not fun, and not secure. The solution to a problem with drowsiness was an app that would wake you up with prompted user input, such as song or buzzing. Drowsiness is a serious problem in America, and especially high schools, and I was intrested to see how we would approach solving it. It makes sense slightly in theory, but in real life would be unpractial and annoying. People know when they are tired, and they don't need to spend money in a device that reminds them of that. Becuase of that, I can't see myself falling in love with this project, and it doesn't seem seecure at all.  </h3>

<h3> This project has a great idea and solution of using Facial recognition for attendance at school, rather than human manual entry. The project's idea is very well organized and fluent, which makes it very attractive. The main problem I have with this project is I don't personally love the idea of the soltuion being implemented into our school, so it would be difficult for me to be fully passionate about it. Also, coding Face ID seems very difficult and out of our reach, and I wouldn't want that to be something learn weeks into the project. I am not an expert on facial recognition, but I beleive the software or intelligence to do so is exepnsive, which would make it difficult to make profit of the project. Also, many people may be opposed to this in schools or work enviorments. So for security reasons, and personal reasons, I declined this project. </h3>

<h3>This propsal really capivated me. The problem was real, hurricanes and sheltering issues. The soltuion of having an app with the data of where to shelther, and other solutions regarding hurriance and other natural disaster soltuions was genius and very nessecary. When these sudden disastors can happen, many reactions can be rushed and based on adrenelene and not what is best for the indiviual or family. Kind of like a chicken running with its head cut off. The app would provide a sharp guidance and wake up-call almost, like a way to calm down the invidual and provide all of the information on how they can be safe. This is crucial in life-or-death situations.  I like the idea of the project, but my problem lies in how it would be made. This seems more of a data entry, and active living app involving daily changes of information. This app can't be made and then kept, it needs to be constantly be changing to the changing information. Becuase of that, I think it would be better for me to a join a group that has one stable set program. For that reason I had to decline this project. I really love this project though. </h3>

<h3> This proposal wasn't fully completed, and the idea seemed too simple. The ISP Project group that I join I want to be good at deadlines an finishing all the work, this project is already lacking those signs, and for that reason I chose not to join this group. </h3>

<h3> This was my own proposal, and I had to judge it with no bias with the other proposals. I like the idea of the website with lots of different interactive activities. I think the soltuion is simple, and can be built upon through hard work. The idea for the project is a website that feautirizes differnet functions to increase IQ and brain health. Some of these include IQ games, recipes with nutrients your body needs, and a live chat box to talk about your health. I think creative problem solving is something that can often be neglected in high school, but it is very important to your brain health and sucsess. It's a project where you get out how much you put in, and that is a type where I am succsessful. The idea needs a small group, and I have canidates that I like their work ethic, and I believe will help me with my idea. I am going to stick with this project and complete it to the best of mine, and my team's ability. </h3>
