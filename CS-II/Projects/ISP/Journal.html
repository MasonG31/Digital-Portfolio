	  <h2> Technical challenges </h2>
	  <h3>My ISP has not started the coding or the technical work on our interactive webpage. We would like to start soon, and before that we need to get the group in order and divide the work with natural roles. I am in favor and pushing to start work as soon as possible, because procrastination and working behind will have no positive impact on our team. I think it is a fact that some members in the team care less about the project and work that needs to be done, but I am enthusiastic and eager to start work. </h3>
	  <h2> Scheduling challenges </h2>
	  <h3> Our group has had some early scheduling challenges, but these have been amplified by school being out of session. Over the winter break there were attempts to gather all memebers of our large team on a discord call to disuss the genesis of our project. Due to work, busy lives, and vacation, it was difficult to find a time that would fit everyone's schedules. This challenge was augmented by the low response times by many members. Talking in person is much more efficient, and trying to work as a group and find a time with each group member responding every couple of hours made a mildly simple task much more complex. A call was arranged, but I was unable to make the call. I think that a problem that won't go away during the duration of our project, is the communication time and efficiency. I will continue to brainstorm individually and as a team how we can work through this issue. </h3>
	  <h2> Interpersonal challenges </h2>
	  <h3> Some of the earliest challenges in our ISP project have been interpersonal. We have made a group message so that all team members are able to communicate with each other, because we have different class periods. Some of the members of the team on the group message have been suffering from immaturity and not using the message for the productive purpose. It's frustrating trying to communicate with the team and make progress when some team members are overly sending memes, spamming, and using the discord message in a light silly way. I personally have no problem with comedy or lighening the mood,  but this project's main purpose should be the project and the webpage result that we are looking for, not hanging out with friends and having fun. I believe the way to solve this problem right now is to make it clear to this team member/s on the level of respect and seriousness that our team plans to have going into the project, so that it is clear from the start. </h3>

	  <h2> Roles in our ISP Project </h2>
	  <h2> (Software) Development Engineer </h2>
	  <h3>A devlopment engineer works in improving the current software and making it more efficient and profitable. A development engineer in our situation will be heavy in the software that we are writing in solving problems and bugs in code, and thinking of new solutions. The devlopment engineer for our team will need strong problem solving skills and the ability to communicate with team-members solutions and ways to make the code easier. I think with our group size, the devlopment engineer may be the head of writing code, but we will see how my team views this proposal. For me personally, software and shell coding isn't by largest strength, so working in finding solutions to code and writing a majority of code wouldn't be a obvious choice for my role in the project. I am happy to do whatever is nessecary, but I am most likely to look into other roles for the team to maximize potential and efficienty.</h3>
	  <h2> QA Engineer</h2>
	  <h3> A quality assurance engineer works in making sure quality of the project is maintained throughout all of the spheres of a project. They work in making sure that the work that is being produced is at par with the quality of the company's vision. Quality and Quantity can sometimes conflict, and it is important to see where the line is drawn in the company's vision. In our project, I can't see how a Quality Assurance Engineer would have any more than a tender amount of work to routinley complete. For this reason having not one set in stone QA engineer, but having this as a half-role for some team members seems most efficient. I believe that I would be great at communication with my teamates as a QA engineer and making sure our project is up to my high standards. Although I don't feel there would be that much work for me to do, and I wouldn't my teamates to think unfairly of me or think that they can match me and do less work. For these reasons, I think that are team will have a QA engineer, but that can't be their only task in the project.</h3>
	  <h2>Project Manager </h2>
	  <h3> A project manager is the executive principal over the project as a whole. The project manager works on a more broad sense over all the teams, in contrast to a devlopment engineer which works with primarly just the software. The project manager needs to have a sound understanding of all of the diverse concepts of a project, in order to correctly piece them together with teamwork and delegation of tasks. A project manager needs great people skills, and the ability to lead. I would be an efficient and enjoyable team manager because of my skills of communciating with team members, the ability to learn information quickly, elite problem solving, and natural leadersip.  </h3>
	  <h2>Product Manager </h2>
	  <h3> The product manager is involved in fitting the customer need with a product we can make, while being efficient and profitable. The product manager is the most involved with customers and the consumers of the product. Beause our projest is making the product, it will be critical for teh product manager to identifiy a need of consumers and if our project would be valued by outside consumers. If the product that we are investing time and figurative money into, isn't viewed as valuable then the project was a waste of our assets. Work will be done regardless, but it is important we are charging and storing in our work into something that will have value in the real world, or whoever our target audience is. I would enjoy being a product manager, and I think my people skills and understanding this side of the business aspect would make me a great fit.  </h3>
	  <h2> Release Engineer </h2>
	  <h3> A release engineer looks over the code that is being wrote and facilitates it into the project software. A great release engineer will need to understand the computer code that is being written, the project itself, and how the software that is being used works: shell, program, guacamole. In a group of our size, I can envision the release engineer being on the code team but also working to move the coding in the right direction. Hopefully in our group we can have all of our programming doen with the forsight and wisdom of a release engineer, asking questions like "How will this work in the final product?", "In what order should we code the program?", "How can we implement this function inside of a larger program?". I think that I will be great at whatever task I assigned/choose for the project, but I think the role of a release engineer would take much more work to get to this level. I think of all of the roles above, a release engineer would be the most challenging for me.</h3>
