      <h1> About the ISP Project </h1>
      <h3> My ISP project will be creating an interactive webpage focused around mental health, brain health, and imporving IQ. This will be done through the use of creative games, a live chat-box feature centerd around healthy communication, and food recipes and snacks that are sceintifically proved to keep the brain funcitoning correclty at the biological level. The project will be on different indepent timelines, with different groups tackling different elements of the interactive website. One of the advantages with our multi-headed approach is that we have more oppurtunites for sucsess and more flexilibty to set-backs. If some of the ideas turn out to be very fruitful, we can tranisiton into making those the pedestal of our project. We are not tied dowm to one single project idea. The exisetnce of different elements, and a vague soltuion to our problem allow for our project to be living and evolving while still fitting comfotably in the paraments of our overall project. Our projected time line goal will to be have one teams building games montly, the chatbox team to complete that by spring, and a smaller team building the physical website. Another benefit of our project is that we have a large team, meaning more minds to solve problems that may pop up for individual teams. The 3 teams are centralized to the main group and able to help and assist another group or indiviual, which is an advantage smaller groups will not have comapred to us. I am very excited and in full belief that our project will be able to not only adress our problem, but provide an efficient and well above adequte solution.  </h3>
