    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <h5>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A bias is any factor or prejudice that can affect decision-making or a choice. Everyday life in humans is full of biases, from choosing an ice cream flavor, what to eat, and our opinions of other people. Bias can have a negative connotation of unfairly ruling a decision, such as a swayed referee, but biases can also be advantageous and assist our judgment when making a decision. Bias is a natural part of being a human and making human decisions, but we need to understand how these biases work so we can control them. Both feelings and facts are important, but when making decisions, it's important to understand and control the extent of biases affecting you as an individual and as a team. My ISP team will be working on a webpage that involves brain health, and in order to reach our full potential will be aware of the most common biases that could influence our decision making.  </h5>
   
    <h2>Anchoring and Adjustment Bias </h2>
    <h5> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This bias occurs when a solution is lured too strongly by an initial estimate or a pre-set estimate. The first impression of a data is highly embossed on the direction of the project or data, when this bias occurs.  For example, if a paragraph response answer is suggested to be 7 sentences to write a complete thought, writers may experience more effort trying to fit into the quantiative parameters (length) than writing a complete thought. In an everyday example, your first impression of a person even though backed off by a small qualitative sample size will stay as the majority of your opinion of the person, and will stay dominant throughout your relationship with the said person(Arnott, 2022). Our ISP group will strive to avoid this bias by having a loose flexible initial goal for the project. By having a loose goal of what our final product will be, we will not be subconsciously tied down to an initial vision. By having small weekly goals, instead of a large overarching plan, we will be able to avoid the Anchoring and Adjustment basis because we will not have an initial solution to base our work on. Also by having confidence in the work we are doing, we will not feel the need to repeatedly compare our project to past example projects or what other groups are working on.</h5>
    <h2>Completeness Bias </h2>
    <h5> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Completeness Bias occurs when data or a presentation is unfairly favored when it appears to be complete or whole. A common social experiment displays this when participants were asked to search for the most credible data, given two different charts. One data set contained values rounded to the hundreds, while the other had values rounded to the second decimal place. The value with more decimal points or complexity, looking more complete, was biasedly believed to be more accurate by test volunteers (Arnott, 2022). My ISP group will avoid this bias by thoroughly looking through all of our problems and solutions instead of quickly choosing what may look more correct or complete with the naked eye. For example, in a long coded function, and a short coded function, we would look deeply into what each one does and how it is written, rather than assuming long means complex and genius, and short code means simple and efficient. We will not seek for value in complexity, or guaranteed quality in quantity. </h5>
      <h2>Confirmation Bias </h2>
      <h5> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This bias occurs when researchers or decision makers tone in more on supporting solutions or facts, rather than looking for alternate theories or answers. The scientific theory involves finding a question, and then looking for strong evidence that supports and little evidence that contradicts the claim. Strong data requires a trip down both roads.  For example when an ancient astronomer claimed that the planets and sun revolved around the earth, the confirmation bias occured and it was not for many years later when a look into the alternate view proved the original theory incorrect (Arnott, 2022). Sometimes fallacies and errors can be discovered by taking a view in the opposite rather than backing it up.  My ISP team will avoid this bias by looking into both sides of the picture in our code. If our code is running, we will not only look at why it is working, but why it could fail. We will look at the reasons an idea could fail before potentially devloping it. Finding ways something may not work before we even begin, seems like an Eeyore or pessimistic view, but in the long run is efficient and will help the team reach solutions to our problems.  </h5>
  <h2>Correlation Bias </h2>
  <h5>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This bias occurs when a human relates or correlates two independent probabilities together when they are unrelated(Arnott, 2022). This is based on limited knowledge and overconfidence in the individual's experience versus natural probability. An example of this could be a Boston Celtic fan always wearing his lucky jersey believing that his choice affects the actual Boston Celtics winning games. This may seem superstitious and uneducated when implemented on a professional basis, but it does have some yield and influence. A way that this could happen to our ISP team is that finding success coding in the morning rather than the evening is based on fact rather than coincidence or unrelated events, which would cause the incorrect belief that we need to code in the morning rather than night. My ISP team can avoid the Correlation Bias by understanding that random events can occur and we should not judge a situation without a large sample size or data correlation. We will work hard, and not rely on external luck or chance to determine our sucsess.</h5>

  <h2>Habit Bias </h2>
  <h5> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Bias is very common in everyday life and in computer science. This bias occurs when a decision is made overly influenced  on past choices. For example, people that claim they always drink coke, take a certain route home, or even sticking with a brand or company based on tradition or habit, even though it may not have the best product or service. Polaroid Camera Company made millions of dollars on consistent consumers buying flashes from their cameras out of habit(Hidden Brain, 2022). Even when it wasn't the best technical camera on the market, the consumers buying out of habit continued to contribute profit to the company. Examples of this occurring in our computer science could be using certain common functions because we are comfortable and used to them in the past, or sticking with a certain practice because we are used to doing it. The Habit Basis restricts your flexibility and ability to solve problems in different ways and most importantly the most efficient way. My ISP team plans to avoid this bias by thinking of the pros and cons of each decision and what is truly the most beneficial to the team.  </h5>

  <h2> Imaginability Bias </h2>
<h5>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This bias occurs when a solution is perceived as easier or simpler because it can be imagined(Arnott, 2022).  While the imagination can be both tangible and intangible simultaneously and a difficult concept to understand, it can play a large role in decision making. Just because a vision of something can be visualized or seen in your head does not mean it is the most accurate solution by any means. And this works in the opposite way as well, meaning just because you can not envision a solution at the moment that does not mean that it is impossible or non-existent. The way my ISP team plans to overcome this bias is by thinking about ways potential solutions can be reached before promptly going to work. Some solutions at first thought may seem difficult or impossible, but could be accomplished by creatively thinking through the problem. This will combat any pre-bias towards a solution in our project.  </h5>
