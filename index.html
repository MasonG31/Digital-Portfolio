    <h1> Hello, I'm Mason Graham</h1>

    <h2> About Me! <h2>
    <h4> I'm 16 years old, and a Junior at AHS, currently in Computer Science II. I started coding when I was about 12, by inspecting my sister's online school pages for fun. When doing this, I learned learning the langauge would make it easier to make her life harder. One thing led to another and I started becoming immersed in code and computer science. Outside of school I love playing sports, my favorite is basketball and football. When playing these sports, I play really agressive, really scrappy, and sometimes a little dirty. I learned quickly that these talents aren't very useful when coding, so doing something clean and perfect was a little bit of an ajustment. </h4>
    <h2> This is the treasure chest storing my works, experiences, progress, and achievemnts that I will be able to look back upon in future years</h2>
    
    <h4> This digital Portfolio is important to me because I will be able to store all of my work over a span of my highschool time. I want to have this time capsule like portfolio so that I will be able to look back on my work that I completed during my computer science and other classes. It will be intresteting and fruitful to look back on the progress of the code I wrote. Another reason that this digital portfolio is important to me is so that I can show future employers, and colledges, the collection of my work. They can see not only the classes that I took, but some of the highlights from those classes inside of this digital portfolio. As of right now, my ISP project is something I would like to brag about, and having it up on my own website that I can show to universities and jobs in the future is something I take a great interest in.</h4>
