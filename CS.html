<h2> Computer Science I </h2>

    <h3> What I learned in Computer Science I</h3>
    <h4> This was the most rigourous computer science class I have ever taken, and it was quite a shock at first, but through hard work I was able to work through it </h4>
    <h4> How to work emacs, create a file, and post it on an html so you can see it on the web. I learned how to make efficent loops, functions, and if else statements that made code that was once long and inefficent, laconic and concise. </h4>
    <h4> I learned how to use peers, classmates, and the internet to learn content and work through code when I had problems, and how to properly cite my sources.</h4>
    <h4> One of the main things I learned from this class, is partly beceause computer science is different than other school classes. Questions in computer science can have an infininte number of solutions, and an infinite number of problems. You can complete work in math without not fully knowing what you were doing. This was not the case at all for computer science. You needed a sound understanding of what all your code did, and exactly how to complete online assingments. At first this threw me for a loop, because I was used to answers and solutions always being just below the surfce. In computer science I learned that you needed to find out how do solve a problem fast, and you needed to do it right. Realiable sources is crucial as well, making sure the sources that you are using to learn from code are the correct and going to help your code, not hurt the code.</h4>
    <h2> Stone Soup </h2>
	<h4> Another lesson that I learned while I was taking Computer Science I, was under the umbrella of the ancient European story of "Stone Soup". In this story a group of wandering travelers with only a bowl, are able to make a delicous bowl of soup for a town, by taking what they all individually had, carrots, water, celery, and make a large product in which they can share. This can apply to coding, and espically the difficult programs and software that we use in Computer Science. You don't need to be and expert in any of these fields, and you don't need to know all of the answers all of the time. You just need to be able to work with your group, large or small, and take little bits of information in what they know, and working together to make a great project. Indivually, some peers may be experts, and many might just know a little bit. But if you mix in the little bit that everyone knows, you can all have something greater than what you could have made on your own. Obvisoully I don't mean anyhting aganist the class rules, or anything close to cheating. I have always been strongly aganist that morally, and just at a logic standpoint that's not a smart idea at all.</h4>
